To heavily customize the display, use the adminpanel to turn off the display on all pages, then add calls to your themefiles: // This is optional extra customization for advanced users`<?php print sociable_html(); ?>` // all active sites`<?php print sociable_html(Array("TimesURL", "Gatorpeeps")); ?>` // only these sites if they are active== Frequently Asked Questions === What makes this plugin different to Peter Harkins Sociable plugin? =The fundamental difference between the two is that this plugin has been customised for South Africa. All the popular South African sites have been prioritised first with the option to activate other International sites thereafter. This version has also been stripped down considerably to be more light-weight.= I found a bug, where do I report it? =Please report any bugs [here](http://timesurl.at/contact/).== Screenshots ==1. The first screenshot shows how the icons appear below a blog post.2.
